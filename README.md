Enterprise Architectures for Big Data project. BIPM Master HWR Berlin. Work in BI

Work in BI is a platform, which aims to provide a holistic overview about the Business
Intelligence job market - it combines insights to the current job market and with the
evaluation of historical data to answer complex user questions regarding the Business
Intelligence job market. The historical data is used to visualize trends and the overall
development of the industry. The historical data is also used to answer general career
questions such as “What is the most requested skill for a Data Scientist in the past 12
months?”. While the current job postings can support the user in finding suitable job postings
accumulated in one platform.

Unlike recruiting and networking platforms (LinkedIn, Stepstone, etc.), Work in BI aims to
help and orient young people who are at the beginning of their career and in need of
centralized, comprehensive and insightful information about the potential careers.

Due to the limited time span of the Big Data course, we developed a Prototype that covers
Business Intelligence careers of the US job market with limited sets of functionalities as
followed:

● Analyzation of possible careers for the Business Intelligence study program

● Visualize current job postings based on region demand

● Analyze if there are any noticeable differences in organizations and the requirement
characteristics per career

● Summarize the popular skill sets needed per career

● Show companies which offer the highest salary
